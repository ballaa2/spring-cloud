Spring Data REST is built on top of the Spring Data project and makes it easy to build hypermedia-driven REST web services that
connect to Spring Data repositories â€“ all using HAL as the driving hypermedia type.

It takes away a lot of the manual work usually associated with such tasks and makes implementing basic CRUD functionality 
for web applications quite simple.
